786.2,IMPRESSION,1. Suggestion of a small pleural effusion on the frontal projection which is not well seen on the lateral view. No consolidative infiltrates are seen.
786.2,IMPRESSION,"A triangular density is identified just posterior to the heart on the lateral film. This creates more of a vague opacity on the frontal exam in the region of the lingula.
