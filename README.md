# ICD (International Classification of Diseases) Classfication ML & flask_API
* Deploy machine learning models in production as APIs (using Flask)
* Flask app to serve predictions for scikit learn support vector machine

## Data Description:
The dataset I used in this project is from a challenge held by the Computational Medical Center in 2007.[File](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cestella/NLPDemo/solution/NLPDemo/src/main/data/sentences.dat) This data contains small sets of sentences with corresponding diagnosis code (ICD-9). 

* diagnosis code
* type
* sentences indicating the code

## Methodology:
I used support vector machine to classify ICD-9 code in this project.
